# nba-topshot-home-feed

A website displaying the home feed from the NBA Top Shot API using GraphQL to subscribe to home-feed updates. The site should dynamically update with new entries as they appear in the feed. It should include a clean, sports-themed design with vibrant colors, preferably in line with the NBA's branding (reds, blues, and whites). The layout should be user-friendly, allowing easy navigation through the latest updates. The website will display items such as new card releases, price changes, and popular trades.
